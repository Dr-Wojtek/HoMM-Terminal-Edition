# See this project's wiki for a detailed breakdown of this program: https://github.com/Dr-Wojtek/HoMM-Terminal-Edition/wiki


This game requires python3 installed. Set dir of the .py files as current working directory and type python3 main.py to start the game.

It is necessary to run this game in full screen on 1080p resolution with standard size of objects.

If the map looks corrupted with black lines and/or you cannot see top and bottom action bars, your resolution is too low. Lower your font size in your terminal settings, open a new window with the new setting and run the game again.

It is recommended to use a light grey background with black letters for your terminal / command line.

When the map opens, there are two strongly coloured action bars; top and bottom. Make sure both of these can be seen; they display all available commands and information to you. If you don't know what to do, look at the top action bar.
