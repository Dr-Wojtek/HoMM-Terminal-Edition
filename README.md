Four towns - Castle, Inferno, Rampart, Tower.
All non-upgraded creatures available and attributes true to original H3.
All creature dw available with mostly true cost, but customized due to differing building requirements vs original H3
Mage Guild/Spellbook implemented. Only 1st and 2nd level spells yet.
Summon Boat implemented. Water impassable without it.
3 heroes for hire per player including first one.
2-4 human players
3 artefacts - sword, shield, boots of speed
No loose resources on map
Map is still fully RNG
Battle AI v0.1. Might break if targets are at the edge of the array/battlefield, as AI may try to move OOB to reach them if AI is blocked by other units.
Rogue enemies implemented on map

Code repetitiveness - None. But still room for much improvement through other means of implementation, for example, loading kingdom and unit info from external DB.

Still missing:
non-RNG mountain ranges and water, to block mountain passing completely
Force wood / ore resource mines close to town
Force populator to not populate if adjacent sq is already populated
Unique, true dwelling requirements
Loose resources on map
Hero AI to enable an AI Player
